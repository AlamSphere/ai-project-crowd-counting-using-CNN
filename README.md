# ai-project-crowd-counting-using-CNN
This mini project is part of my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on understanding the fundamentals of counting the headcounts of the crowd using an ai model rather than manually counting eah and everyone through hands-on implementation using Python and basic AI/ML concepts.
# Mini AI Project – CROWD COUNTING USING CNN

## 📌 Overview
This is a *mini project* created as part of my learning journey in *Artificial Intelligence*.
The goal of this project is to understand and implement the core concepts behind *how can ai solve our day to day life*.

I am still a learner, and this project represents my *hands-on practice*, experimentation, and understanding of fundamentals.

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to approach a real-world problem using AI
- Understand data preprocessing, model logic, and evaluation
- Gain confidence by building and completing a working mini project

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- [NumPy / Pandas / TensorFlow / PyTorch / OpenCV — whatever you used]
- Basic concepts of AI 

## 📊 What I Learned
- How to structure an AI project
- Basics of model training and evaluation
- Importance of clean data and experimentation
- How theory connects with practical implementation

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve model performance
- Try different algorithms / architectures
- Deploy as a simple application (future goal)

##  Note
This project is part of my *learning phase*, and I welcome feedback, suggestions, and guidance.
