# ai-project-crowd-counting-using-CNN
## 📌 Project Description

This project is a *beginner-level implementation of Crowd Counting using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*.  
It was developed as part of my learning journey in *Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning* to understand how CNNs can be applied to estimate crowd counts from images.

The model is built using *TensorFlow and Keras, where images are passed through convolutional layers and the network learns to predict a numerical crowd count. For demonstration purposes, **randomly generated data is used, and this project focuses more on **understanding the workflow and concepts* rather than achieving production-level accuracy.

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding CNN architecture for regression tasks  
- Image preprocessing and normalization  
- Model training, validation, and prediction  
- Using MAE and MSE as evaluation metrics  
- Practical use of TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV  

## ⚠ Note
This is a *learning-focused mini project*, not a fully optimized or deployed system.  
Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
